# TCL Learning Directory

I made this repo to document the actual syntax of the language, as well as make some simple practice problems that I could work through on my own.
After this, you should have a decent familiarity with TCL so that you can use JasperGold, edit Hammer files, etc (among other things).


## Structure

- `Core_Concepts/` — Contains progressive learning scripts and a detailed README covering TCL syntax, rules, and practical examples.
- `Syntax_Practice/` — Contains practice problems and exercises for you to solve in TCL to reinforce your learning.

## How to Use

1. **Start with the `Core_Concepts/` folder:**
   - Work through the scripts in order to learn TCL syntax and features.
   - Refer to the `Core_Concepts/README.md` for a detailed guide and explanations.

2. **Move to the `Syntax_Practice/` folder:**
   - Try solving the practice problems to test and reinforce your TCL knowledge.
   - I may add problems later, but overall the point of this repo is just to teach/practice fundamentals.

Enjoy! :)
